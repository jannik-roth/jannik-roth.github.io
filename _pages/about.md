Hello and welcome to my personal webpage. My name is Jannik and I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Bonn. My research focuses on the use of Machine Learning in Cheminformatics. I try to develop machine learning models that help us develop new drugs faster and safer. I'm especially interested in ligand-based potency/activity prediction as well as understanding what ML models are actually learning for these tasks.

I hold a BSc Chemistry (University of Bonn) and an MSc Chemistry (University of Munich). My studies focused on theoretical chemistry with a good mix between application and method developement.

Here on this site you will find a lot of information about me and my research. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me via mail at [jproth@bit.uni-bonn.de](mailto:jproth@bit.uni-bonn.de).
